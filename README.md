**GEFEST** (**G**enerativ **E**volution **F**or **E**ncoded **ST**ructures) is a toolbox for the generative design of
physical objects.

It uses: (1) numerical modelling to simulate the interaction between object and environment;
(2) evolutionary optimization to produce new variants of geometrically-encoded structures.

The basic abstractions in GEFEST are Point, Polygon, Structure and Domain.

...

The workflow of the generative design is the following:

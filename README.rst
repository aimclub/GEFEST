**GEFEST** (**G**\enerative **E**\volution **F**\or **E**\ncoded **ST**\ructures) is a toolbox for the generative design of
physical objects.

In core it uses:
1. Numerical modelling to simulate the interaction between object and environment
2. Evolutionary optimization to produce new variants of geometrically-encoded structures

The basic abstractions in GEFEST are Point, Polygon, Structure and Domain.

The workflow of the generative design is the following:

How to use
==========

All details about first steps with GEFEST might be found in the `quick start guide <https://gefest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gefest/quickstart.html>`__
and in the `tutorial for novices  </docs/tutorials/sample.rst>`__

Project Structure
=================

The latest stable release of GEFEST is on the `main branch <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main>`__.

The repository includes the following directories:

* Package `core <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/gefest/core>`__  contains the main classes and scripts. It is the *core* of GEFEST framework
* Package `cases <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/cases>`__ includes several *how-to-use-cases* where you can start to discover how GEFEST works
* All *unit and integration tests* can be observed in the `test <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/test>`__ directory
* The sources of the documentation are in the `docs <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST/tree/main/docs>`__

Current R&D and future plans
============================

Currently, we are working on integration of new types of physical objects with consideration of their internal structure.\n

The major ongoing tasks:

* to make the use of GEFEST more accessible and simple for users
* to integrate three dimensional physical objects
* to implement gradient based approaches for optimization of physical objects
* to improve efficiency of GEFEST's standard sampler
